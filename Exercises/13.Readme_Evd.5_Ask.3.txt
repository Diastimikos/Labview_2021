### Project: Multi-Operation Calculator

**Description:**  
The VI allows the user to input four numbers (**A, B, C, D**) and perform one of three operations selected via a numeric control **Number Operations**:  
- 0 – Addition: all numbers are added together and the Addition LED lights up.  
- 1 – Multiplication: all numbers are multiplied together and the Multiplication LED lights up.  
- 2 – Average: the average of the numbers is calculated and the Average LED lights up.  
- 3 – Default: no calculation is performed.  

For operations 0, 1, and 2, the message "Calculations" is displayed.  
For operation 3, the message "No Calculations" is displayed.  

The VI runs inside a While Loop and continuously updates the result until the Stop Button is pressed.

**Controls:**  
- A, B, C, D – numeric inputs for the numbers.  
- Number Operations – numeric control to select the operation (0-3).  
- Stop Button – stops the While Loop and terminates the VI.

**Indicators:**  
- Result – shows the output of the selected operation.  
- Addition LED – lights up when Addition is performed.  
- Multiplication LED – lights up when Multiplication is performed.  
- Average LED – lights up when Average is performed.  
- Message Display** – shows "Calculations" or "No Calculations" based on operation.

**Concepts:**  
- While Loops & Loop Iteration  
- Numeric Controls & Indicators  
- Case Structures for multiple operations  
- Conditional Operations (Addition, Multiplication, Average)  
- Boolean Indicators (LEDs)  
- Dynamic messaging based on operation
