### Project: Blink LEDs

**Description:**  
This VI implements a simple LED blink program.  
It runs inside a **While Loop** until the **Stop Button** is pressed.  
- A numeric **Integer input** is connected to a **Wait (ms)** to control the loop speed.
- Two LEDs (**A** and **B**) are used to indicate different states.  
- A **Case Structure** with **True/False** selects which LED lights up:  
  - **True → LED A**  
  - **False → LED B**  

The loop can iterate continuously, and by using the **Loop Iteration (i)** terminal, the state of True/False can be toggled to create a blinking effect.

**Controls:**  
- **Integer Input** – sets the Wait time (ms)  
- **Stop Button** – stops the While Loop

**Indicators:**  
- **LED A**  
- **LED B**

**Concepts:**  
- While Loops & Loop Iteration  
- Wait (ms) for controlling loop speed  
- Case Structure for conditional operations  
- Boolean Indicators (LEDs)
