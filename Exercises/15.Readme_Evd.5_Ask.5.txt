### Project: Engine Speed Monitor with Stage Indicators

**Description:**  
This VI monitors and displays engine speed in RPM, and indicates the current stage based on the speed.  
The program runs inside a While Loop until the Stop Button is pressed.

- The user selects the Engine Speed (0–5) using an analog Slide.  
- The speed is multiplied by 10,000 to convert to RPM and displayed on a Meter named "RPM" with a scale of 0–50,000.  
- A Case Structure with 6 cases selects the appropriate stage based on the rounded Engine Speed (`round toward + infinity`).  
- The multiplied RPM value is passed into the Case Structure for stage comparison.

**Cases:**

| Case |          Condition         |    Message   |  LED  |
|------|----------------------------|--------------|-------|
| 0    | Default (Engine Speed = 0) | "Engine off" | None  |
| 1    |       RPM ≤ 10,000         |  "1st stage" | LED 1 |
| 2    |       RPM ≤ 20,000         |  "2nd stage" | LED 2 |
| 3    |       RPM ≤ 30,000         |  "3rd stage" | LED 3 |
| 4    |       RPM ≤ 40,000         |  "4th stage" | LED 4 |
| 5    |       RPM < 50,000         | "Overload-danger\nSTOP ENGINE OPERATION" | LED 5 |
| 5 Special |  RPM = 50,000         |  Blink all LEDs with Wait 250 ms  | All LEDs |

**Special Case: Max RPM Blink**  
When the Engine Speed reaches 50,000 RPM, all LEDs blink to indicate overload.  
- A Feedback Node stores the previous LED state.  
- A NOT function inverts the state, creating an alternating on/off signal.  
- A Selector chooses between the normal condition (RPM < 50,000) and the inverted state.  
- A Wait (250 ms) controls the blink frequency.  

This ensures all LEDs blink continuously until the engine speed is reduced below 50,000 RPM.

**Controls:**  
- Engine Speed Slide (0–5) – selects desired engine speed.  
- Stop Button – stops the While Loop.

**Indicators:**  
- RPM Meter – shows the current RPM (0–50,000).  
- Message Output – displays current stage or warnings.  
- LEDs 1–5 – indicate the current stage.  

**Concepts:**  
- While Loops & Loop Iteration  
- Analog Controls (Slide)  
- Numeric Scaling & Conversion (Speed × 10,000 → RPM)  
- Case Structures for conditional logic  
- Boolean Indicators (LEDs)  
- Conditional Messaging  
- LED Blinking with Wait (ms)
