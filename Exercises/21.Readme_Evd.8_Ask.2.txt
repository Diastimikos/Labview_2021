### Project: Tank Values Logger to Excel

**Description:**  
The program demonstrates real-time logging of tank values into an Excel file using LabVIEW:  
- The While loop runs continuously until the Stop Button is pressed or the number of columns entered is equal to 0.  
- The user provides the Excel file path (via Block Diagram) where the results will be stored.  
- The user sets the Tank values using a Knob (0–1000).  
- The tank values are (after multiplied by 50):  
  - Displayed digitally 
  - Displayed graphically 
- Each value is:  
  - Added to an array using Build Array  
  - Inserted into the array using Insert Into Array, in the next position from the previous value  
- A Wait (1000 ms) sets the delay between iterations.  

**Controls:**  
- Knob (0–1000) – selects Tank value  
- Stop Button  
  
**Indicators:**  
- Numeric indicator – current Tank value  
- Graphical indicator – scaled Tank value  
- Array – stores sequential tank values  

**Concepts:**  
- While Loops
- Array manipulation (Build Array, Insert Into Array)  
- Scaling of values  
- Comparisons and logical operations  
- Case Structures
