### Project: Engine Status Monitoring and Saving

**Description:**  
The program continuously monitors the status of three engines inside a While Loop until the Stop button is pressed. When Stop is pressed, the final results are saved into an `.xls` file at the path specified in the Block Diagram.  

**Controls:**  
- Engine 1 (LED) → ON/OFF state.  
- Engine 2 (LED) → ON/OFF state.  
- Engine 3 (LED) → ON/OFF state.  
- Stop Button → ends program execution and triggers file saving.  

**Indicators:**  
- Live Engine Status (1D array, 3 elements) → shows real-time ON/OFF values of the engines.  
- Final State to be Saved (1D array, 3 elements) → shows the last recorded state of the engines when Stop is pressed.  

**Concepts:**  
- While Loop with Stop control.  
- Boolean to (0,1) conversion for LED states.  
- Build Array to collect engine status values.  
- Build Path to specify the storage location.  
- File saving into `.xls` format.
