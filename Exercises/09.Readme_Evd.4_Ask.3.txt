### Project: Random Number Comparison

**Description:**  
The VI generates two random numbers (**A** and **B**) on each iteration of a While Loop.  
Each number is multiplied by **1000** and rounded to the nearest integer.  
The program compares the two rounded numbers. The loop continues until either the numbers are equal (turning on the **Equality Found** LED) or the **Stop** button is pressed.  
The **Comparison Tries** indicator shows how many times the loop attempted a comparison.

**Controls:**  
- **Stop Button** – stops the While Loop manually.

**Indicators:**  
- **Equality Found LED** – lights up when the rounded numbers are equal.  
- **Comparison Tries** – shows the number of comparison attempts.

**Concepts:**  
- While Loops & Loop Iteration Terminal (`i`)  
- Numeric Operations (Multiply, Round To Nearest)  
- Random Number Generation  
- Comparison & Conditional Logic
