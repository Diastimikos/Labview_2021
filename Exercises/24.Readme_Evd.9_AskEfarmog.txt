### Project:
LabVIEW 3D & Waveform Graph Visualization

**Description:**  
This LabVIEW project generates and visualizes data based on user-defined frequency and amplitude values. The data is displayed in both a 3D Graph and a Waveform Graph, allowing the user to observe how input parameters affect the plotted results. The application also provides functionality to export the 3D Graph as a JPEG image.

**Controls:**  
- Frequency (numeric control): Sets the frequency of the generated signal.  
- Amplitude (numeric control): Sets the amplitude of the generated signal.  
- OK Button: Starts the data generation and plotting process.  
- STOP Button: Stops the execution of the program.  

**Indicators:**  
- 3D Graph: Displays a surface plot of the generated signal data.  
- Waveform Graph: Displays the waveform corresponding to the signal values.  

**Concepts:**  
- Signal generation using frequency and amplitude parameters.  
- Data visualization in 3D surface plots and 2D waveform graphs.  
- Image export from LabVIEW graphs to external files (JPEG format).  
- Use of loops and control logic to manage execution flow.
