### Project: Username and Password Input

**Description:**  
The VI allows the user to enter a **Username** and a **Password**.  
- The **Username** input displays the characters as typed.  
- The **Password** input masks the characters with `***`.  
- The program performs a comparison to ensure that the fields are not empty:  
  - `Username != " "`  
  - `Password != " "`  
If a field is empty, the program displays a warning message:  
- "Username cannot be `" "`"  
- "Password cannot be `" "`"  

The entered values are displayed on the screen when the **OK** button is pressed.  
The loop continues until the user presses either the **OK** or **Cancel** button.

**Controls:**  
- **Username String** – input field for the username.  
- **Password String** – input field for the password (masked).  
- **OK Button** – confirms input and displays the entered values.  
- **Cancel Button** – stops the input loop.

**Indicators:**  
- **Username Display** – shows the entered username.  
- **Password Display** – shows the entered password (masked or as appropriate).  
- **Warning Message** – alerts if any field is left empty.

**Concepts:**  
- While Loop for repeated input until user confirmation
- String Controls & Indicators  
- Masked Input for Passwords  
- Conditional Logic (empty field checks using `!= " "`)  
- Event Handling (OK / Cancel buttons)
