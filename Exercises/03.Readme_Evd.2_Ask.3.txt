### Project Cylindrical Fuel Tank Height Calculation

**Description**  
The VI calculates the height of a cylindrical liquid fuel tank based on user inputs for **Volume** and **Radius** (via arrows or keyboard, allowing integers and decimals).
- Volume is entered in liters via a numeric control.
- Radius is entered in meters via a numeric control.  
- The calculated tank height is displayed both  
  - Numerically in a separate indicator  
  - Visually on a graphical display with a maximum of 100 meters  
Note: For graphical representation, the tank radius starts at 1 m and the volume at 10,000 L.  
The VI currently runs with Run Continuously for demonstration purposes.

A StartStop switch, using a Select Function, controls the calculation  
- If the switch is TRUE, the height is calculated  
- If the switch is FALSE, the output is 0  

Controls  
- Volume (L)  
- Radius (m)

Indicators  
- Tank Height (numeric)  
- Tank Height (graphical display)  

Concepts  
- Numeric Controls & Indicators  
- Unit Conversion (L → m³)  
- Numeric Functions (Multiply, Divide)  
- Select Function (conditional calculation)
