### Project: Slide-Controlled Thermometer with Repetition Tracking

**Description:**  
The program demonstrates repetitive data acquisition and visualization inside a While Loop:  
- The loop runs continuously until either of the two Stop Buttons is pressed.  
- A Time Delay of 1 second is used between iterations.  
- The user controls a Slide (0–10), which is scaled and displayed on a Thermometer (0–100).  
- An Array "Repetition value per 1 sec" records the slide value for each iteration.  
- Two additional indicators display:  
  - Number of Table Elements – shows how many values have been recorded in the array.  
  - Average Temperature – calculates the mean of all recorded values.  

**Controls:**  
- Slide (0–10) – selects the value to display.  
- Stop Button 1 & Stop Button 2 – stops the While Loop.  

**Indicators:**  
- Thermometer (0–100) – graphical display of the current slide value.  
- Repetition Array – logs slide values per iteration.  
- Number of Table Elements – shows how many repetitions have been recorded.  
- Average Temperature – shows the mean of all recorded values.  

**Concepts:**  
- While Loops with multiple Stop conditions  
- Time Delay (1 second)  
- Slide Control & Scaling  
- Graphical Indicators (Thermometer)  
- Arrays for storing repeated measurements  
- Array Size & Average Calculation
