### Project: 2D Array Processing with File Storage

**Description:**  
The program generates and processes a 2D array using nested For Loops. Random numbers between 0–1 fill the array. Results are displayed through various indicators and stored in a `.doc` file at a specified path in the Block Diagram.  

**Controls:**  
- Line Selection → selects one row of the array.  
- Column Selection → selects one column of the array.  

**Indicators:**  
- 2D Array (12×6) filled with random numbers.  
- Array Size (1×2) showing rows and columns.  
- Max Value of the array.  
- Min Value of the array.  
- Desired Line array (selected row).  
- Desired Column array (selected column).  
- Line Average value.  
- Column Average value.  
- Error Out indicator (for file path or saving issues).  

**Concepts:**  
- Nested For Loops (outer loop: 12 iterations, inner loop: 6 iterations).  
- Random Number generation (0–1).  
- Array handling (size, indexing, selection).  
- Calculation of max, min, and average values.  
- File storage in `.doc` format.  
- Error handling with Error Out.
