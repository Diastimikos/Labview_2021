### Project: Array Operations & Average Calculation

**Description:**  
The program consists of **two parts**:

1. **Array Concatenation Demonstration**  
   - Two numeric arrays are combined using the Build Array function.  
   - The result is displayed twice:  
     - With Concatenate Inputs = ON → produces a single 1D array.  
     - With Concatenate Inputs = OFF → produces a 2D array (each input becomes a row).  

2. **Average of Array Elements**  
   - The program runs inside a While Loop until all the elements of the array are accessed.
   - The loop takes an input array and processes its elements one by one.  
   - On the first iteration, the first element is added to a constant 0, and the result is stored in a Shift Register.  
   - On subsequent iterations, each array element is added to the accumulated value stored in the Shift Register.  
   - When all elements have been processed, the total sum is divided by the number of iterations (equal to the array length).  
   - The Average value of the array elements is displayed.  

**Controls:**  
- Two Numeric Arrays (input for concatenation)  
- One Numeric Array (input for average calculation)  
- Stop Button  

**Indicators:**  
- Concatenated Array (Concatenate ON result)  
- 2D Array (Concatenate OFF result)  
- Numeric Indicator: Average Value  

**Concepts:**  
- Build Array (1D vs 2D, Concatenate option)  
- While Loop Iterations  
- Shift Registers for cumulative sum  
- Array processing element by element  
- Average Calculation (Σ elements ÷ number of elements)
